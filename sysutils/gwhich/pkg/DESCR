GNU which takes one or more arguments. For each of its arguments it
prints to stdout the full path of the executables that would have been
executed when this argument had been entered at the shell prompt. It
does this by searching for an executable or script in the directories
listed in the environment variable PATH using the same algorithm as
bash(1).
