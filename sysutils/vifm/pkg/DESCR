Vifm is a curses based vi[m] like file manager extended with some useful
ideas from mutt. If you use vi[m], vifm gives you complete keyboard
control over your files without having to learn a new set of commands.
It goes not just about vi[m] like keybindings, but also about modes,
options, registers, commands and other things you might already like in
vi[m].

Just like vi[m], vifm tries to adhere to the Unix philosophy. So instead
of working solutions which are set in stone user is provided with a set
of means for customization of vifm to one's likings. Though builtin
functionality should be enough for most of use cases.
