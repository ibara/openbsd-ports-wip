Kefir is a C17 language compiler from scratch. No existing open source
compiler infrastructure is being reused. The main priority is
self-sufficiency of the project, compatibility with platform ABI and
compliance with C17 language standard. Some exceptions to the standard
were made (see Exceptions section below). At the moment, the initial
scope of work is effectively finished, and the main concern is
stabilization, bugfixes and UX improvements. Kefir supports modern
x86-64 Linux and FreeBSD environments. Compiler is also able to produce
JSON streams containing program representation on various stages of
compilation (tokens, AST, IR), as well as outputting source in
preprocessed form. By default, the compiler outputs GNU As-compatible
assembly (Intel syntax with prefixes). At the moment,
position-independent code generation is not supported.
