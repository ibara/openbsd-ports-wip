chibicc is yet another small C compiler that implements most C11
features. chibicc supports almost all mandatory features and most
optional features of C11 as well as a few GCC language extensions.
chibicc does not support complex numbers, K&R-style function prototypes
or GCC-style inline assembly. Digraphs and trigraphs are intentionally
left out.
