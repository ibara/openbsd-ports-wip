TinyCC is a small and fast C compiler.

Features:
* SMALL! You can compile and execute C code everywhere, for example on
  rescue disks.
* FAST! tcc generates optimized x86 code. No byte code
  overhead. Compile, assemble and link about 7 times faster than
  'gcc -O0'.
* UNLIMITED! Any C dynamic library can be used directly. TCC is
  heading toward full ISOC99 compliance. TCC can of course compile
  itself.
* SAFE! tcc includes an optional memory and bound checker. Bound
  checked code can be mixed freely with standard code.
* Compile and execute C source directly. No linking or assembly
  necessary. Full C preprocessor included.
* C script supported: just add '#!/usr/local/bin/tcc -run' on the first
  line of your C source, and execute it directly from the command line.
